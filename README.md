# ServoController

This is a controller written for the Arduino Nano to run a brushed DC motor in closed loop with input from GRBL for a CNC machine.

## Components

* Arduino Nano
* Incremental encoder
* STEP/DIR DC motor driver
* Brushed DC Motor

PID controller gains will need to be tuned to suit your motor.
